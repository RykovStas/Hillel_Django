## This is my first Django Project

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def start(request):
    return HttpResponse("It's my first Django Project - Catalog!!!")
```

*I have created files - requirements.txt, .gitignore, venv and so on...*

*I have created app - catalog and add to installed apps*




### **I have failed because I have pushed Secret KEY. But I fixed this**
